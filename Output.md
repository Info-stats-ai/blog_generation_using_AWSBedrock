Here is the detailed blog on AI agents in markdown format:

# Introduction
AI agents are programs that can learn, reason, and act on their own. They are the building blocks of artificial intelligence and are used in a wide range of applications, from playing games to controlling robots. In this blog, we will explore the concept of AI agents, their types, and their applications.

## Types of AI Agents
### 1. Rule-Based AI Agents
Rule-based AI agents are based on a set of predefined rules that are used to make decisions. They are typically simple and easy to understand, but can be inflexible and difficult to modify.

### 2. Decision Trees
Decision trees are a type of rule-based AI agent that use a tree-like structure to make decisions. They are commonly used in decision support systems and are often used for classification and regression tasks.

### 3. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
ANNs are a type of rule-based AI agent that use artificial neural networks to make decisions. They are commonly used in image and speech recognition tasks.

### 4. Hybrid AI Agents
Hybrid AI agents combine multiple AI approaches, such as rule-based and ANNs, to make decisions.

## Applications of AI Agents
### 1. Game Playing
AI agents are used in game playing to make decisions and adapt to changing game conditions. They are commonly used in chess, Go, and other strategy games.

### 2. Robotics
AI agents are used in robotics to control robots and make decisions in complex environments. They are commonly used in autonomous vehicles and warehouse robots.

### 3. Healthcare
AI agents are used in healthcare to make decisions and diagnose diseases. They are commonly used in medical diagnosis and patient care.

### 4. Finance
AI agents are used in finance to make decisions and predict market trends. They are commonly used in portfolio management and risk analysis.

## Advantages of AI Agents
### 1. Flexibility
AI agents are flexible and can be easily modified and adapted to new situations.

### 2. Autonomy
AI agents are autonomous and can make decisions without human intervention.

### 3. Scalability
AI agents can be scaled up or down depending on the needs of the application.

## Disadvantages of AI Agents
### 1. Limited Understanding
AI agents may not have a deep understanding of the problem domain and may make suboptimal decisions.

### 2. Lack of Common Sense
AI agents may not have a good understanding of common sense and may make decisions based on rules rather than real-world experience.

### 3. Dependence on Data
AI agents are dependent on high-quality data to make accurate decisions.

## Conclusion
AI agents are powerful tools that can be used in a wide range of applications. They offer flexibility, autonomy, and scalability, but also have limitations such as limited understanding and lack of common sense. By understanding the types, applications, advantages, and disadvantages of AI agents, we can harness their power to create more intelligent and effective AI systems.

# Example Use Cases
### 1. Playing Chess
A chess-playing AI agent is used to play chess against human opponents. The agent uses a combination of rule-based and ANNs to make decisions and adapt to changing game conditions.

### 2. Autonomous Vehicles
An autonomous vehicle uses an AI agent to control the vehicle and make decisions in complex environments. The agent uses a combination of rule-based and ANNs to make decisions and adapt to changing conditions.

### 3. Medical Diagnosis
A medical AI agent is used to diagnose diseases based on medical data. The agent uses a combination of rule-based and ANNs to make decisions and diagnose diseases.

# Code Example
```python
import numpy as np

class DecisionTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    def train(self, data):
        # Split the data into features and labels
        features = data[:, 0]
        labels = data[:, 1]

        # Find the best split point for the first feature
        best_split_index = 0
        best_gain = 0
        for i in range(1, len(features)):
            gain = self.gain(features, labels, i)
            if gain > best_gain:
                best_gain = gain
                best_split_index = i

        # Create the decision tree
        self.root = self._create_tree(features, labels, best_split_index)

    def predict(self, data):
        # Make a prediction using the decision tree
        features = data[:, 0]
        prediction = self.root.predict(features)
        return prediction

    def _create_tree(self, features, labels, split_index):
        # Create a new node in the decision tree
        node = Node(split_index)
        node.feature = features[split_index]
        node.label = labels[split_index]

        # If this is the last feature, make a decision
        if len(features) == 1:
            return node
        else:
            # Split the data into left and
